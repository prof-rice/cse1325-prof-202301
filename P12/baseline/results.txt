HOMEWORK P12 RESULTS
====================

Spring 2023

NOTE: We will not be grading for "correct" answers, since your results may vary, but rather answers that are consistent with your measured results.

IMPORTANT: If at all possible, time your program on a machine with at least 4 cores. (CSE VM may be configured to use multiple cores in the VirtualBox properties panel.)

FULL CREDIT
===========

QUESTION 1: Which puzzle did you use as ThreadsOfSudoku's parameter to achieve a 30+ second runtime (using "real"):

QUESTION 2: Provide the full ``time`` output for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. It may prove interesting to screenshot your system monitor while these run. You may be able to run all of these with a single bash command if you like (replace 14_zeros with your puzzle from QUESTION 1): 

for i in {1..16} ; do printf "\n Threads %d:\n" $i ; time (java ThreadsOfSudoku $i puzzle.txt 14_zeros > temp.txt) ; done

Example Timing (first 2 of 16 runs only on Antares):

ricegf@antares$ for i in {1..16} ; do printf "\n Threads %d:\n" $i ; time (java ThreadsOfSudoku $i puzzle.txt 14_zeros > temp.txt) ; done

 Threads 1:

real	2m0.684s
user	2m0.919s
sys	0m0.292s

 Threads 2:

real	1m4.553s
user	2m7.003s
sys	0m0.252s



YOUR Timing:






QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?





QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?





BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your thread pool version of ThreadsOfSudoku as you did for the full credit version. Post your timings here.

YOUR Timing:






QUESTION 6: Is a thread pool faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? 



QUESTION 7: Compare the full credit and bonus solution code. Which do you believe is more supportable over a long lifetime of evolving hardware and environments?
